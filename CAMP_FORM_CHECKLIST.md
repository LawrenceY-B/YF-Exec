## üöÄ Priority 1: Critical Functionality

### Age Auto-Calculation
- [ ] **Auto-calculate age from DOB field**
  - Implement `useEffect` to watch DOB changes
  - Calculate age in years from date of birth
  - Auto-populate age field when DOB is selected
  - Handle edge cases (future dates, invalid dates)

### Conditional Required Fields
- [ ] **Dynamic validation based on form responses**
  - `conditionDetails` ‚Üí Required when `conditions` = "Yes"
  - `allergyDetails` ‚Üí Required when `allergies` = "Yes" 
  - `otherChurch` ‚Üí Required when `homeChurch` = "Other"
  - `supportAmount` ‚Üí Required when `support` = "Yes"

### Conditional Field Visibility
- [ ] **Show/hide fields based on previous answers**
  - Hide `conditionDetails` unless `conditions` = "Yes"
  - Hide `allergyDetails` unless `allergies` = "Yes"
  - Hide `otherChurch` unless `homeChurch` = "Other"
  - Hide `supportAmount` unless `support` = "Yes"

## üéØ Priority 2: Enhanced UX Features

### Group-Based Conditional Fields
- [ ] **Bible Study Group Name field**
